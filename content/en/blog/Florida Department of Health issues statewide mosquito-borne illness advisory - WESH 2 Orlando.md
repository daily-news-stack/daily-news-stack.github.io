## **Floridians Urged to Protect Themselves Against Mosquito-Borne Diseases**

*June 30, 2023*

In light of the increasing mosquito population and the heightened risk of mosquito-borne diseases, health officials in Florida are urging residents to take precautions to protect themselves. The state has witnessed a surge in mosquito activity, partially attributed to recent weather conditions and environmental factors.

To safeguard against these pesky insects and reduce the chances of contracting mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile virus, dengue fever, and Zika virus, Floridians are advised to follow these recommended measures:

### Apply Bug Spray: 
It is crucial to regularly apply an effective insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus to exposed skin. This will act as a deterrent and significantly reduce the likelihood of mosquito bites.

### Avoid High Mosquito Population Areas:
Whenever possible, individuals should steer clear of areas known for having high mosquito populations. These areas may include stagnant water bodies, marshlands, and densely vegetated regions. Taking proactive steps to avoid these locations can greatly minimize mosquito encounters.

### Wear Protective Clothing:
Wearing long pants, long-sleeved shirts, socks, and shoes helps create a physical barrier between skin and mosquitoes. Choosing light-colored clothing can also help deter mosquitoes, as they tend to be attracted to darker shades.

### Eliminate Standing Water:
Mosquitoes breed in standing water, so it's essential to eliminate any potential breeding sites around homes and communities. Regularly emptying containers that collect rainwater, checking gutters for blockages, and maintaining swimming pools and birdbaths can significantly decrease mosquito populations.

### Time Outdoor Activities Wisely:
Mosquitoes are most active during dawn and dusk. Whenever feasible, scheduling outdoor activities during other times of the day can minimize exposure to these biting insects.

While the focus is on Floridians due to the particular circumstances in the state, these recommendations can also be applicable to individuals residing in other regions with similar mosquito-related concerns.

By implementing these preventive measures, Floridians can reduce their risk of mosquito bites and protect themselves from potential mosquito-borne diseases. Health authorities emphasize the importance of individual responsibility in preventing the spread of such illnesses, urging residents to stay informed and share this information with friends and neighbors.

It is imperative for every individual to take necessary precautions and adopt these preventive practices to ensure a safer and healthier community for all. Stay safe and mosquito-free!
